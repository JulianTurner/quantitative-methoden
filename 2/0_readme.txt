There are four files:
 - insurance_data_clean.xls (contains the cleaned insurance data --- hypothetical, but realistic),
 - bank_customers.xls (contains the bank customers data --- hypothetical, but realistic),   
 - 0_run_intro.R (contains R commands for a short intro into R) 
 - 1_run_A5.R (contains R commands which solve A5),
 - 2_run_A6.R (contains R commands which solve A6).
 
The latter two files are ASCII files, that is, you can open them with a simple text editor. 
("Kate" is an example of a suitable text editor.)

To run in R (www.R-project.org): 

1. Open R.

2. Change directory to the folder where files are located.
   (Or start R right from this forder.)
   The R command getwd() shows you where you are. 
   The command setwd(...) lets you change the directory. 
   The command dir() lists the contents of the current folder.
   
3. 0_run_intro.R: Enter the code line by line into the R command box and observe!       

4. Enter the command source("1_run_A5.R") or source("2_run_A6.R") into the R command box.
   (Of course, you could also enter the code line by line. In doing so, the print command can be neglected.)


Good luck.
